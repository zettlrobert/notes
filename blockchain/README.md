# Blockchain

### Underlying Technology

Encryption + Distribution

A Network of Computers colaborate to maintain a secure and shared Database
**Distributed Secure Database**
Consists of a Chain of Encrypted Blocks where every Block has an Unique Identifier, called Hash

In order to make an entry on to the blockchain database all the computers have to agree about its state so that no one computer can make an alteration with the consensus of others.

Each Time a Block gets completed it gets linekd onto the Chain.
Transactions are Immutable, can not be deleted

Each Hash is dependent on the Hash before --> each other Hash would change if one is tempered with.

## Permanent and Secure Database

Secure Distributed Records are called Ledges
