# Streams

Node.js streams are based on **EventEmitters**
 * stream.on['data'] 
  * reading data
 
 * stream.on['readable']
  * reading data
 
 * stream.on['close']
  * emmitted when streams are ending

 * stream.on['end']
  * on readable side

 * stream.on['finish']
  * emmitted when streams are ending 

 * stream.destroy
  * full thing died
