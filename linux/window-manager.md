## dwm
complicated and not good ot use at first
* needs to be compiled
* dynamic window manager


## xmonad
suckless and similar to dwm
* written in Haskell
* first login, blackscreen
* xmobar panel required
* master and stack layout is default
* traditional grid layout is possible
* a lot of layouts to choose form
* most difficult tiling window manager

## qtile
almost exactly like xmonad
* dynamic tiling window manager
* written in python
* writte config and customization is easyer
* default layout monad master and stack
* multimonitor like xmonad


## awesome(window manager)
* easy window tiling manager
* comes with a panel 

## i3
* prebuild layouts
* easy to configure




qtile, awesome and i3 are good to get started!
