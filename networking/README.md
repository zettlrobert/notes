## What is a Network
* a network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology
* data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media such as twisted pair of fiber optic cables or by wireless methods such as Wi-Fi microwave transmission or free space optical communication

## Servers, Clients, Ports and Protocols

### Server
* In computing, a server is a computer programm or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients"
* This architecture is called the client-server-mdoel, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.

### Client
* a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses  a service made available by a server

### Ports
